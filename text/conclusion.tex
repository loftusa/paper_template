\section{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}

Put in the conclusion everything that wants to have gone into the introduction, but wouldn't have made sense for lack of context. Should be a short summarizing paragraph. Under no circumstances should the paragraph simply repeat material from the Abstract or Introduction. In some cases it's possible to now make the original claims more concrete, e.g., by referring to quantitative performance results. Discuss open questions you'd like other researchers to think about. Likely only the 5ish people most interested in your paper will actually read this section, so it's worth somewhat tailoring to that audience. Unfortunately, paper reviewers might also read this section, so you can't tailor it too much. This section is most important when submitting to NIPS or ICML, sometimes you can skip it in other conferences.
