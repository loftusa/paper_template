\section{Appendices}
Appendices should contain detailed proofs and algorithms only. Appendices can be crucial for overlength papers, but are still useful otherwise. Think of appendices as random-access substantiation of underlying gory details. As a rule of thumb:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Appendices should not contain any material necessary for understanding the contributions of the paper.
    \item Appendices should contain all material that most readers would not be interested in.
\end{itemize}
