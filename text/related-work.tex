\section{Related Work}
\label{related}

Roughly 1 page. Good density of citations \cite{alex1994example} - not too sparse but not too crowded.

Keep this here if related work can be short yet detailed enough, or if it's critical to take a strong defensive stance about previous work right away. In this case Related Work can be either a subsection at the end of the Introduction, or its own Section 2.

Put this section at the end if it can be summarized quickly early on (in the Introduction or Preliminaries), or if sufficient comparisons require the technical content of the paper. In this case Related Work should appear just before the Conclusions, possibly in a more general section "Discussion and Related Work".
