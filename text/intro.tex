\section{Introduction}
\label{introduction}

% coherent top level narrative
% describing what I want to do in comments
% before I write the paper
% to organize thoughts

% - avoid using vague phrases like "much recent interest" and "increasingly important"
% - provide context before introducing a new concept. 
% - don't beat around the bush; if the point is A -> B, then say that, rather than just being humble and pointing out A.

Roughly one page total. One paragraph for each of the below. Organize each paragraph around a single concrete point stated in the first sentence that is then supported in the rest of the paragraph.

\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the problem?
\item Why is it interesting and important?
\item Why is it hard? (E.g., why do naive approaches fail?)
\item Why hasn't it been solved before? (Or, what's wrong with previous proposed solutions? How does mine differ?)
\item What are the key components of my approach and results? Also include any specific limitations.
\end{enumerate}
