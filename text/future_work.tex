\section{Future Work}

Show how the work new research directions. Use bullet lists. A couple of things to keep in mind:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Say if we're actively engaged in follow-up work, say so. E.g.: "We are currently extending the algorithm to... blah blah, and preliminary results are encouraging." This statement serves to mark your territory.

    \item Conversely, be aware that some researchers look to Future Work sections for research topics. 
\end{itemize}
