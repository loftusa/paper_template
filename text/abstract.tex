The first sentence/phrase should be something that all readers agree with. The second should be something that many readers would find surprising, or wouldn't have thought about before; but it should follow from (or be supported by) the first sentence. Warm the reader up with context. State the problem, your approach and solution, and the main contributions of the paper. Include little if any background and motivation. Be factual but comprehensive. The material in the abstract should not be repeated later word for word in the paper.
